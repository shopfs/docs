# Shop FS

## Introduction

- The user adoption that we have seen accross Web3 has been phenomenal be it accross Blockchain/DLT's or Decentralized Storage, I will focus on latter part for now IPFS has been a revelation in the Web3 Space where users can store & access content in a decentralized way.

- The Challenge that IPFS has faced is user incentivization though Filecoin has taken some big steps towards there is still a need of a good Interface where users and potentially buy and sell decentralized content.

- With the current infrastructure though you get incentivized with Filecoin but the user visibilty we feel is not that great for either party, so through Hack FS we are introducing Shop FS a peer to peer decentralized marketplace where users can buy and sell decentralized content with a smooth and secure payment channel and a subscription model.


## Our Solution

- With Shop FS we aim to provide users a sustainable UI Interface with an array of options to buy and sell decentralized content using [Fleek Space Daemon](https://blog.fleek.co/posts/daemon-release), in addition we also are coming up with a Subscription Model to benefit the buyers and sellers even more powered by [EIP 1620](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1620). The complete dApp is powered by [Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com/) for better access to blockahin data.


## Functionality


### Sell

- You can add any type of file on the platform and ask a price for private access of that file, currently the price limit is 20 DAI.

- Once you upload the file, transaction will happen on the Ethereum Blockchain and your signatire will be requested to ensure private access of your file, it will get uploaded to Fleek Space Daemon.

### Buy

- Navigate to our file explorer, you will find all kinds of details regarding each file and the $DAI Amount you need to pay to have private access of that file. 

- Once bought you come to the explorer and download it any time once you provide your digital signature.

### Subscriptiona

- This is perphaps the most interesting thing that we have introduced on our platform which caters to both the seller's and buyer's need.

- The subscription model allows a seller to create a subscription for a particular duration by virtue of which a buyer after streaming the payment can access all of that seller's files without buying them individually.

- As a seller this gives an opportunity to get more buyers interested as compared to selling a single file, you can withdraw subscription amount, enable or disable anytime you want.

- From a buyer point of view, you will pay once based on the per day proce asked by the seller and you can cancel your subscription any time and based on the payment rate of the
[EIP 1620](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1620) Stream, both sellers and buyers will get their share of the amount calculated by the contract.
