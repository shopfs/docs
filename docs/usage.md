Currently, users must install and run **Fleek Space Daemon** before interacting with our dApp.

It is still possible for users to buy files on the dApp, but in order to upload or download files privately, **Fleek Space Daemon** is required.

Users can follow the steps mentioned in the Fleek Space Daemon documentation [here](https://github.com/FleekHQ/space-daemon) and download the latest binaries for their OS from [here](https://github.com/FleekHQ/space-daemon/releases).

Users must install and run the latest version the daemon before uploading or downloading files on shopFS.
