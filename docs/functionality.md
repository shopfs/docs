### Sell

- You can add any type of file on the platform and ask a price for private access of that file, currently the price limit is 20 DAI.

- Once you upload the file through our UI to to Fleek Space Daemon, we record the file details on the Ethereum Blockchain through a transaction and also your signature will be requested to ensure private access of your file.

### Buy

- Navigate to our file explorer, you will find details regarding each file and the $DAI Amount you need to pay to have private access of that file. 

- Once bought you can download the file any time once you provide your digital signature.

### Subscriptions

- This is perhaps the most interesting thing that we have introduced on our platform which caters to both the seller's and buyer's need.

- The subscription model allows a seller to create a subscription for a particular duration by virtue of which a buyer while streaming the payment can access all of that seller's files without buying them individually.

- As a seller this gives an opportunity to get more buyers interested as compared to selling a single file. The seller must set a price and a minmum duration of subscription. Later the seller can withdraw the current balance from any active subscription at any time. They can also disable subscriptions if they choose to.

- From a buyer's point of view, they will make a one-time payment based on the price set by the seller and they can cancel their subscription at any time and based on the payment rate of the [EIP 1620](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1620) Stream, both sellers and buyers will get their share of the amount at that particular time as calculated by the contract.
