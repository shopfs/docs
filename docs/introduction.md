- The user adoption that we have seen across  Web3 has been phenomenal be it across  Blockchain/DLT's or Decentralized Storage (IPFS). In particular IPFS has been a revelation in the Web3 Space where users can store & access content in a decentralized way.

- The Challenge that IPFS has faced is user incentivization, though **Filecoin** has taken some big steps towards it, there is still a need of a good Interface where users and potentially buy and sell decentralized content.

- With the current infrastructure though you get incentivized with Filecoin but the user visibility we feel is not that great for either party, so through HackFS we are introducing **ShopFS** a peer to peer decentralized marketplace where users can buy and sell decentralized content with a smooth and secure payment channel and a subscription model.
