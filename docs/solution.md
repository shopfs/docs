- With **Shop FS** we aim to provide users a sustainable User Interface with an array of options to buy and sell decentralized content using [**Fleek Space Daemon**](https://blog.fleek.co/posts/daemon-release), in addition we have also come up with a Subscription Model powered by [**EIP 1620**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1620) to benefit the buyers and sellers even more. The dApp is also powered by [**Graph Protocol**](https://thegraph.com/) for better access to Blockchain and IPFS data 


- We know that with our use case there will be talks around private access for the files since users are paying for them, hence we have come up with a very minimalistic architecture for the same, with the introduction of a Fleek's Space Daemon which stores files in private encrypted form in buckets & a **Node Red Monitoring Service** that overlooks all events happening on the contract through Graph and after verification of signatures from both sellers & buyers we ensure the the buyer have private access to the file.
