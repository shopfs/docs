- For our private data sharing needs we started with **3Box Confidential Threads**, but after a good effort spent on trying to include it for a good 2 weeks we found out from the team that since there infra is located in USA, we faced syncing issues, hence we hope to get in touch with them and try including 3Box Threads, so right now we are catering the private sharing with a provate firebase store to which only our Monitoring Service has the write access.

- Since we are using **Fleek Space Daemon**, for which in order to interact with our platform, you have to have Space Daemon Running locally so after the we will be in touch with the Fleek team to have a remote daemon running which is better for the user visibility.
